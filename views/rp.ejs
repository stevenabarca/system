            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>When you cancel a booking and are entitled to a refund then we will instruct the refund 
            right away. The processing will take between 2-4 weeks until the whole amount shows back 
            on your credit card statement. Reasons for this are the billing cycle of your credit 
            card company and processing time of the bank. The refund amount depends on numerous 
            factors such as the hotelâ€™s cancellation policy, time of cancellation and processing fees.
            For more details see cancellation policy above.</p>

            <p>In case a reservation that you make is not confirmed, we will not charge you anything 
            on your credit card and release the whole amount that was held on it immediately. Now after
            we do this, it will still take a maximum of 2-4 weeks for the bank to process this and for
            the money to show back on your credit card.</p>

            <p>If cancelled within 0-72 hours prior to Check In date, one night retention will be 
            charged and balance will be refunded, subject to deduction of 5% cancellation charges 
            in case payment is done via Instamojo/Credit/Debit card.</p>
            
            <h4>Standard Rate</h4>
            <p>The cancellation is free of charge 7 days prior to the date of arrival, after this time
            we charge you 90% the room rate as cancellation fee,  if we could not sell the room more.</p>
